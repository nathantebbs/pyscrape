	<h1>PyScrape Test Webpage</h1>
	<p>Hello, this webpage is a testing utility for the PyScrape CLI</p>

	<h2>Why use PyScrape?</h2>
	<p>PyScrape is designed for getting downloadable content from simple websites</p>
	<p>The idea for this tool came from spending, granted a small fraction of time, going through various webpages,
		related to school or other pursuits. and needing to download their <span
			style="text-decoration: underline">linked content</span></p>

	<h2>What websites does the CLI work on?</h2>
	<p>PyScrape works best on websites that look a lot like this!</p>
	<p>Using webscraping we are able to programatically target links that contain specific types of content like pdfs,
		by filtering through file extensions.</p>
	<p>This means that if you see content like <span style="font-weight:800">this:</span></p>

	<p>In the past, I have gone through individual items for a given web page that looked a lot like this one. However,
		I made a key mistake. I should've just downloaded all the content related to that class, in case I might need it
		later!</p>
	<p>Some may call this hording, I call it archiving. Either way, sorting a websites content and downloading
		all it has to offer is the inteded use of this tool, enjoy!</p>
